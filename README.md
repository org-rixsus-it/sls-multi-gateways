# sls-multi-gateways

sls-multi-gateways is a tool that allows you to run multiple api gateways under one domain for local development purposes. <br /><br />
[Here is a walkthrough article on medium](https://medium.com/@edisgonuler/run-multiple-serverless-applications-d8b38ef04f37)

## Installation

sls-multi-gateways needs to be installed globally using the following command inside this project:

```bash
npm install -g
```

## Usage

After installing sls-multi-gateways, cd into your project directory

```bash
cd [project-directory]
```

Create a sls-multi-gateways config file

```bash
touch sls-multi-gateways.yml
```

Inside your sls-multi-gateways config file add the services you would like to run

```bash
port: [port the proxy will run on - (optional: default is 3000)]
stage: [stage the proxy will run on - (optional: default is dev)]
services:
  - srvName: [name of the service]
    srvPath: [proxy path to the service]
    srvSource: [path to the serverless.yml file belong to that service]
    stripBasePath: [whether the srvPath will be passed on to the proxy]
  - srvName: [name of the service 2]
    srvPath: [proxy path to the service 2]
    srvSource: [path to the serverless.yml file belong to that service]
    stripBasePath: [whether the srvPath will be passed on to the proxy]
```

All srvPaths by default are mapped to `localhost:[port]/[srvPath]`. To remove `srvPath` , set `stripBasePath` to `true`.
<br /><br />

To run sls-multi-gateways, execute the following cmd in the directory with the config file

```bash
sls-multi-gateways
```
